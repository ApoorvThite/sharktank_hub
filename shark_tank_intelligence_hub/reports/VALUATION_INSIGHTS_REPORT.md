## 🧮 VALUATION CALCULATOR FRAMEWORK

### For Revenue-Generating Startups

**Formula:**
```
Recommended Valuation = Revenue × Base Multiple × Margin Multiplier × Patent Multiplier × Team Multiplier
```

**Components:**

1. **Base Multiple** (Industry-specific)
   - Technology: 15-28x
   - Medical: 12-36x
   - Food: 7-11x
   - Fashion: 8-9x

2. **Margin Multiplier** (1.0 - 1.35x)
   - Gross margin > 60%: +0.20x
   - Net margin > 25%: +0.15x

3. **Patent Multiplier** (1.0 or 1.4x)
   - Has patents/IP: 1.4x
   - No patents: 1.0x

4. **Team Multiplier** (0.8 - 1.2x)
   - Based on team quality score (1-10)
   - Formula: 0.8 + (quality / 25)

**Example:**
- Industry: Technology
- Revenue: ₹450L
- Gross margin: 75%, Net margin: 30%
- Has patent: Yes
- Team quality: 8/10

**Calculation:**
- Base: ₹450L × 27.89x = ₹12,550L
- Margin: 1.35x (both bonuses)
- Patent: 1.4x
- Team: 1.12x (8/25 + 0.8)
- **Result: ₹26,567L (₹265.7Cr)**
- **Range: ₹21,253L - ₹31,880L**

### For Pre-Revenue Startups

**Formula:**
```
Valuation = Base × Team × Market × Stage × Traction × Patent
```

**Base Valuations by Industry:**
- Technology: ₹1000L (₹10Cr)
- Medical: ₹1500L (₹15Cr)
- Food: ₹300L (₹3Cr)
- Fashion: ₹500L (₹5Cr)

**Multipliers:**
- **Team Pedigree** (1.0-1.5x): IIT/IIM, past exits
- **Market Size** (1.0-1.3x): TAM >₹100Cr = 1.3x
- **Product Stage** (0.7-1.2x): Idea=0.7x, Launched=1.2x
- **Traction** (1.0-1.3x): Users/waitlist/LOIs
- **Patent** (1.0 or 1.4x): Has IP = 1.4x

**Example:**
- Industry: Medical/Health
- Team: 9/10 (IIT founders, healthcare experience)
- Market: ₹5000Cr
- Stage: Beta
- Traction: 2000 users
- Patent: Yes

**Calculation:**
- Base: ₹1500L
- Team: 1.45x
- Market: 1.15x
- Stage: 1.0x
- Traction: 1.2x
- Patent: 1.4x
- **Result: ₹4200L (₹42Cr)**
