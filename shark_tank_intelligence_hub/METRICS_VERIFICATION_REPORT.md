## 📈 VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

### Data Source
- Primary: `data/processed/processed_data_full.csv` (702 rows, 137 columns)
- Deals subset: 465 rows where `Received Offer == 1`

### Calculation Methods

**Valuation Multiples:**
```python
# Only deals with positive revenue and valuation
valid_deals = deals[(deals['Yearly Revenue'] > 0) & 
                    (deals['Valuation Requested'] > 0)]

# Calculate multiples
multiples = valid_deals['Valuation Requested'] / valid_deals['Yearly Revenue']

# Remove extreme outliers
multiples = multiples[multiples <= 100]  # or 250 for Tech/Medical

# Use median (more robust than mean)
median_multiple = multiples.median()
```

**State Statistics:**
```python
# Group by state
state_stats = df.groupby('Pitchers State').agg({
    'Startup Name': 'count',  # Pitches
    'Received Offer': 'mean'  # Success rate
})

# Calculate average deal for each state
state_deals = deals[deals['Pitchers State'] == state]
avg_deal = state_deals['Total Deal Amount'].mean()
```

**Metro Classification:**
```python
metro_states = ['Maharashtra', 'Delhi', 'Karnataka', 
                'Tamil Nadu', 'Telangana', 'West Bengal']
```
